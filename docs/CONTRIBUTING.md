## Guidelines

### General guidelines

- The master branch is where incoming new features are merged (the next coming release).
- All new features / bugs should be done in dedicated branch from the `master` branch.
- It's a very nice thing to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR. It's easier to review it. Then we will squash it before merging.

### Commit messages

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) as commit convention, because it's fun and provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used. All you just have to do is to find the emoji corresponding to the purpose of your commit in [this list](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) following by a short message explaining the update. You can also add a description if it's needed. That's all ;)
